# ðŸ“Š Artificial Art Detection

> **Utilizing Image Recognition Algorithms To Detect Artificial Art, Including AI-Generated Images and Deepfakes**

## Project Description (Big Idea)

By using ANNs and YOLO models, we aim to create an easy way for users to discover whether or not an image is AI-generated, leading to a user base more aware of the images they see and interact with.

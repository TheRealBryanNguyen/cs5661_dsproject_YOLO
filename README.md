# ðŸ“Š Artificial Art Detection
> Example:  
> **YOLO**

## Project Description (Big Idea)

The overall quality of AI-generated images is improving at a rapid pace. Combined with a low barrier of entry that only continues to get lower as time goes on, this leaves many users unable to recognize what images they have discovered online are real or have been generated by an AI algorithm. We have a publicly available dataset with various labeled AI-generated images and real images. By using many models, from CNN, YOLO, ANN, among others, we plan on finding the best way to efficiently and effectively determine if a given image is AI-generated or not. By doing this, we can help Internet users gain a better understanding towards distinguishing between an image or art piece that is artificially generated or was created by a human. Gaining such a skill generally leads to better online experiences. 


By using ANNs and YOLO models, we aim to create an easy way for users to discover whether or not an image is AI-generated, leading to a user base more aware of the images they see and interact with.
